    <h2 id="inputstream">Input stream guidelines</h2>
    <p>Providing a high-quality, stable input stream is the only way to ensure the best user experience for viewers. A good input stream provides the best video quality at the highest consistently available bandwidth from a location.</p>
    <h3>Input restrictions</h3>
    <p>In order to ensure the highest quality, most consistent streaming experience, Brightcove Live limits input stream settings to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maximum 1920x1080</li>
      <li>Maximum 30 fps, which is typical. Brightcove supports up to 60 fps, but you will need to <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com/create">Contact Brightcove Support</a> to have the limit increased. When using 60fps, Brightcove recommends increasing the bitrate to achieve the desired visual quality for the content and a constant frame rate.</li>
      <li>Less than 10 Mbps</li>
      <li>Constant Bitrate (CBR) greatly reduces the chance of problems</li>
      <li>Audio sampling rate: 44.1khz and 48khz are the recommended sample audio rates to use</li>
      <li>Keyframe Rate or GOP (Group of Pictures) aligned:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>A <strong>Keyframe</strong> should always occur every 2 seconds <strong>for both inputs and outputs</strong>. Meaning a keyframe is sent to Brightcove from the encoder every two seconds of the stream itself. This process can be defined in different ways, but <strong>Keyframe Rate</strong> is the most common. </li>
          <li>It can be calculated in different ways by different encoders. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>Wirecast uses the amount of frames that pass, so for a 30fps video, the setting would be 60.</li>
              <li>Elemental encoders use seconds so that the correct setting would be '2'.</li>
              <li>60 FPS video will only change if this setting is counted by the frames, in which case every 120 frames would equal 2 seconds.</li>

            </ul>


          </li>



        </ol>
        <li>If there is an option for <strong>Keyframe Aligned</strong>, <strong>Sync GOP</strong>, <strong>Align Keyframes</strong>, or something along those lines, make sure Keyframes are aligned. When Keyframes are not aligned, it causes synchronization issues with HLS segmentation. </li>




      </li>







    </ul>
    <h3>Testing bandwidth</h3>
    <p>The first step towards arriving at the appropriate settings for the input stream is to determine the available bandwidth on site. There are a few tools that can help:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SpeedOf.Me (<a href="https://speedof.me">http://speedof.me</a>) - Determining the total bandwidth available for HTTP connections is a good first step. However, since the input feed will be streamed to the Live module over RTMP instead of HTTP, the actual bandwidth available for RTMP connections will be significantly less.</li>
      <li>Speedtest (<a href="http://www.speedtest.net">http://www.speedtest.net</a>) - Online tool for determining current upload and download speeds.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Input Bandwidth</h3>
    <p>Providing a high-quality, stable input stream is the only way to ensure the best user experience for viewers. A good input stream provides the best video quality at the highest consistently available bandwidth from a location.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Minimum input bandwidth: 2.5 mbps</li>
      <li>Maximum input bandwidth: 10 mbps</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For the best user experience, match your output renditions to the quality of your encoder stream.</aside>
    <h3>Determining encoder capabilities</h3>
    <p>Understanding the capabilities of the software and hardware used to encode the live stream and send it to the Live module is also important. There may be plenty of bitrate to send a high-quality, 1080p input stream, but the hardware also needs to be able to encode in faster-than-realtime speeds. Some encoding tools display information about the total CPU usage and bandwidth being used. For example, Telestream Wirecast will display the output statistics at the top of the page. This information is useful when determining the most stable, highest quality stream that is possible on given hardware.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/get-started/13289/node13289-wirecast.png" /></figure>
    <p>Things to watch in Wirecast:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CPU should be less than 80%</li>
      <li>Datarate should be near the target bitrate</li>
      <li>FPS should be at the rate of the input stream settings</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="prepare">Preparing for an event</h2>
    <p>Before using the Live module for a production event, testing the entire end-to-end chain is critical to ensure success. There are two main areas to test:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The video production workflow</li>
      <li>The tools being used to connect to the Live module</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For every new location, or any time hardware or software configurations change, a new round of testing should be performed.</p>
    <h3>Production</h3>
    <p>The live feed being generated and sent into encoding hardware or software can be as simple as a webcam and as complex as a multi-camera, edited live broadcast. In either case, the incoming video feed must be consistent throughout the event. Ensure that switching between camera angles or systems results in the same resolution and number of audio channels.</p>
    <h3>Connection to the Live module</h3>
    <p>The connection to the Live module should be tested on the same network, using the same input live feed, being sent through the same encoding software as will be used for the production event. The goal is to mimic the production event as closely as possible.</p>
    <h3>The Day of the Event</h3>
    <p>You should plan on starting the live stream at least 10 minutes earlier than the scheduled broadcast. Starting 30 minutes early will provide some extra time to coordinate and solve any issues.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="issues">Issues during live streaming</h2>
    <p>The work of testing a live stream, finding the ideal settings for the input stream, and preparing the venue for the event will greatly reduce the chance of errors occurring. However, it is important to always be prepared to handle any issues that may arise.</p>
    <h3>Disconnects</h3>
    <p>Network outages, encoder malfunctions, or power outages can all contribute to the Live module connection being lost. Live events have a <strong>Reconnect Time</strong>, which is the time in minutes to wait for a stream to reconnect. When a connection is lost, the Live module disconnects the after the chosen Reconnect Time. Set the reconnect time by expanding the <strong>Advanced Options</strong> when creating an event:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/get-started/13289/node13289-adv-options.png" /></figure>
    <p>The Live module will accept any number of disconnects and reconnects during this reconnect time without needing to start a new stream. Once a stream has been reconnected, playback will resume from the most recent frame. If the event ends without the stream being reconnected, the player will return a warning that the stream was not found.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: When disconnecting and reconnecting, the stream settings must stay the same. Any changes to the number of audio channels, resolutions, or codec settings will result in unpredictable behavior.</aside>
    <h3>Latency</h3>
    <p>Streaming latency, or the time difference between the events a viewer is watching and the actual live event, is introduced in three places:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The on-site encoder</li>
      <li>Cloud transcoding</li>
      <li>CDN delivery</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The on-site encoder and the Live moduleâ€™s cloud transcoding system introduce a total of 1.5 to 5 seconds of latency. Depending on the CDN, there may be another 15-90 seconds of latency introduced. In general, latencies between 15-90 seconds are considered normal for live feeds and are necessary for the Live module to be able to serve millions of concurrent viewers watching live events.</p>
